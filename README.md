# AWS Academy Data Engineering (ADEv1)

## Course version

This course outline applies to version 1.0 of AWS Academy Data Engineering in English.

## Description

AWS Academy Data Engineering is designed to help students learn about and get hands-on practice with the tasks, tools, and strategies that are used to collect, store, prepare, analyze, and visualize data for use in analytics and machine learning (ML) applications. Throughout the course, students will explore use cases from real-world applications, which will enable them to make informed decisions while building data pipelines for their particular applications.
